\subsection{Relevant Weather Information} \label{sec:relevantweatherinformation}
One of the criteria according to the initial problem statement (p. \ref{sec:ips}) is the definition of the weather conditions where it is relevant to apply sonification.

\subsubsection{Pre-test} \label{sec:pretest} 
An early test was conducted in order to identify and define the relevant weather information. 
The test took the form of a simple interview with open ended questions.
The questions were designed to identify the situations in which the users consult a weather forecast and what specific information they are looking for when looking at a weather forecast.
The provided situations will be used in a delimitation to find a suitable situation where sonification of weather information may provide an improvement or an equal experience to visually represented weather information.
The important weather features provided will be used to identify what conditions should be sonified as the audio should only provide information that the user will actually find relevant.
