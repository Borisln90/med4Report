\subsection{Initial Problem Statement} \label{sec:ips}
Is it possible to successfully use sonification to convey relevant information about weather conditions as efficiently as visually represented weather applications?

\begin{itemize}
\item Sonification: 
Define Sonification, types of sonification and what types of data it can convey etc.
\item Weather application content:
Research that indicates specific data which should/ ought to be conveyed.
\item Weather Sonifications:
What has been done before, and how did they "do it"?
\item From visual to auditory data:
Find research that indicates how the weather data can be converted to sonified data.
